# ECE717_FinalProject
Final Project for ECE717: Linear Systems. Trajectory Tracking with a Quaternion-based Quadcopter Model

This project contains 4 trajectory tracking controller designs for the quaternion-based quadcopter model.
Two of them are based on feedback-linearization and 2 of them are based on equilibrium point linearization (hover).

For more details, take a look at the [Final Report](https://github.com/freiremelgiz/ECE717_FinalProject/blob/master/ECE717_FREIRE_Final_Project.pdf)

## Code

To run the simulation, download the source code and add to your MATLAB path. Run `quatquad_main.m`
